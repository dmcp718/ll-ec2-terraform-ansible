# Variable Substitution Analysis

## Current Issues and Recommendations

1. **Region Definition**
   - Currently hardcoded in main.tf: `region = "us-east-2"`
   - Should use: `region = var.aws_region`
   - Benefit: Centralizes region configuration

2. **Instance Type**
   - Currently hardcoded in main.tf: `instance_type = "t3.xlarge"`
   - Should use: `instance_type = var.instance_type`
   - Note: Default in variables.tf is "t3.medium" - consider updating the default to match current usage or adjust based on requirements

3. **Instance Name**
   - Currently no name tag is applied to the instance
   - Should add: `tags = { Name = var.instance_name }`
   - Benefit: Improved resource identification and management

4. **Security Groups**
   - Current: Direct reference to single security group
   - Could use: `vpc_security_group_ids = var.security_group_ids`
   - Note: Would need to update the security_group_ids variable type definition to be complete

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider adding variables for:
   - EBS volume sizes and configurations
   - IOPS and throughput settings
   - SSH key name and location
   - AMI owner ID

2. The hardcoded SSH private key path should be parameterized:
   ```hcl
   private_key = file("/Users/davidphillips/Documents/Cloud_PEMs/us-east-2.pem")
   ```
   Should be changed to use a variable for better portability and security.

3. The subnet configuration (`var.subnet_id`) is defined but not used in main.tf. Consider implementing this for network configuration flexibility.

## Implementation Priority
1. Region variable substitution (high priority - affects resource location)
2. Instance type variable usage (high priority - affects cost)
3. Instance naming (medium priority - affects resource management)
4. Security group configuration (medium priority - affects security posture)
5. Additional parameterization (low priority - nice to have improvements)
